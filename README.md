ARMServerSetup
==============

A setup script targeted for ARM based linux servers.

I initially created this for quickly configuring Raspberry PIs, but recently I have used and tested
it on a number of ARM platforms.

The script is super extensible, an install module can easily be added by creating a file in the
modules directory.

To run:

./install.sh

Contributions welcome!
